## Project Proposal

### Introduction

Recognizing various forms of land use via satellite imaging is an important means of measuring urban spread and human development. Using Tensorflow Keras, this project will use satellite images of urban and sub-urban settings to classify land use (e.g. freeway, agriculture, forest, etc.). The ultimate goal of this project is to take high-definition satellite images of whole cities and generate statistics on land use.
